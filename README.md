**Author Information:** Kim Stanley Robinson lives in Davis California on some kind of pretty normal sounding micro hippie commune based on some kind of European community where people have their own houses but shared spaces like a playground etc. He has 2 or 3 kids and his wife is an accomplished environmental scientist specializing in water management.

**Setting:** In terms of time the book takes place over the course of one or two decades in the late early 2000s. This makes it interesting in terms of it being science fiction since most people reading the book will be alive during the decades covered in the book and most of the technology in book is pretty familiar or at least easy to imagine actually existing soon.

In terms of geography the book takes place mainly in a handful of locations spread around the world. The first location of the book is in rural India where the heat wave disaster that sparks most of the books events takes place. Most of the book ends up taking place in Zurich Switzerland where the Ministry for the Future's main offices are located. Periodically the main characters visit the mountains outside Zurich. Periodically the main characters go to San Francisco and there are a variety of other locations visited that visited just once as disconnected short-stories and some that are not specified but that seem to be in Africa, the Rural US etc.
